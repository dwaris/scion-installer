# scion-install.sh: Scion's verified install for the Exynos 9810 Galaxys (S9 starlte, S9+ star2lte, Note9 crownlte), run from
# TWRP's terminal (adb shell, or Advanced > Terminal) against a zip universal/mkinstaller.sh made. It is a second way in beside
# update-binary, which it does not replace and does not change. TWRP stays where it is: RECOVERY is never written.
#
#   sh scion-install.sh --zip ZIP [--mode kernel-update|full] [--apply] [--log FILE] [--expect-device starlte|star2lte|crownlte]
#                       [--zip-sha256 HEX] [--backup-dir DIR]
#   sh scion-install.sh --print-manifest starlte|star2lte|crownlte
#
#   --mode kernel-update   (the default) writes BOOT, and nothing else. The system image must already be on the phone: SYSTEM is
#                          read and its SHA-256 compared with the image this zip was made with, and a phone whose SYSTEM is
#                          something else (Android, an older build) is refused, with what to do. BOOT is copied to RAM first and
#                          put back if what was written does not read back right.
#   --mode full            writes SYSTEM (the iOS system image, from the zip) and then BOOT. The zip's members are checked by
#                          their SHA-256 before the first write. SYSTEM has no copy to go back to: restore your TWRP backup.
#   --apply                without it nothing is written, anywhere: it is a dry run that does every check and says what it would
#                          write. A dry run is the default, and it is the thing to share first (its log).
#   --log FILE             the log (default /tmp/scion-install-DATE.log; a copy goes to /sdcard when that is writable). It lists
#                          what was looked at and decided, with the partition table it saw, so that you can send it to us.
#   --expect-device NAME   refuse unless the phone is this one (a second look, if you have several phones' zips)
#   --zip-sha256 HEX       the zip's own SHA-256, from the .sha256 file build-installer.sh wrote: refuse a zip that differs
#   --backup-dir DIR       where BOOT's copy goes (default /tmp, TWRP's RAM disk)
#
# Written, only with --apply, only these: BOOT; and SYSTEM in --mode full. USERDATA is on the allow-list in the sense that it is
# the only other partition Scion's installers ever format, but this script never does: a zip made with mkinstaller.sh -U and
# update-binary does that. EFS, SEC_EFS, CPEFS, RADIO, CP_DEBUG, RECOVERY, PARAM, UP_PARAM, PERSISTENT, STEADY, BOTA0/1, DTB,
# DTBO, KEYSTORAGE, NAD_REFER, RPMB, TIMA and the boot chain are refused by name and by the block device their names resolve
# to. RECOVERY's and EFS's SHA-256 are taken before and after, and a change is reported as a failure.
#
# Every check comes before the first write; a refusal says what to do. The images are the user's own build, from the user's own
# IPSW: the zip carries them, this script carries nothing of Apple's, Samsung's or anyone's.
#
# Nothing here has been run on a phone. tools/test_scion_install.py runs it on a computer against fake partition files.
# Test hooks (SCION_TEST_*, below) exist only for that.
